# multlingva_LFPC
This is a small repository and also quite a dumb idea. At the end of this thing what i want to get out of this repo is a little bit more of a diversity in my programming choices and not to be stuck with a "but i only know C" like i did in my second year, and maybe give myself a little more options.

## So what do i exactly wanna do
* try to write some clean code in terms of following conventions and stuff
* split programs in multiple files 
* learn how to use makefiles
* try to familiarise with languages to at least some degree 

## What languages are chosen
* C++ because it is what feels the most at home
* Java and C# because they feel like the more common option
* C because i wanna make my code cleaner
* Lua because it is the scripting language i like
* (more languages to be added maybe like rust and golang but idk yet)
* Python because well with how much i despise it i might still have to use it someday

## is there really a point to it though?
I think that it still generally more beneficial than not. Plus it's at least ***A*** dire attempt to move away from reinventing the wheel every time working with C
